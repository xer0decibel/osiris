 * Page-view analytics to a self-hosted Umami — and nothing unless one is
 * configured.
 *
 * Every page load used to post two events, a page view and a "Network Log"
 * carrying the visitor's IP, to the Umami container on the original
 * deployment's compose network, with that deployment's site ID written into
 * the code as the fallback. Anyone running a copy was therefore reporting to
 * someone else's analytics whenever that hostname resolved, and paying two
 * failed requests per page view whenever it did not.
 *
 * Now a deployment opts in. Set UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID, and UMAMI_URL if the server
 * is not the compose default, and the events are sent; leave them unset and
 * this middleware does nothing at all. The original deployment keeps its
 * analytics by setting the one variable it already had a slot for.
